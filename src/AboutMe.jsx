            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>My background is in life sciences. I have a degree in Biomedical Sciences and I used to work in an NHS medical laboratory. However, I've always had a passion for computing and realised that I really enjoyed the technical side of my role. Thus, I decided to change my career path and learn how to code.
                I love programming an application, debugging it and watching it come to life on screen.</p>
            <h3>Coding Journey</h3>
            <p>I began my coding journey with Harvard's <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science" target="_blank">Introduction to Computer Science</a> course, learning the fundamentals of programming in C.
            The course briefly touched upon all areas of the development cycle. However, I was most passionate about front-end development and decided to focus my attention there. I learned JavaScript, HTML and CSS by reading books, taking <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> courses and experimenting in VSCode. Eventually, I branched out to responsive web design and front-end development libraries including React and jQuery. Building projects from scratch with freeCodeCamp provided a valuable learning experience and further developed my skillset.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Alongside programming, I like yoga, candle-making and gaming in my free time.</p>
