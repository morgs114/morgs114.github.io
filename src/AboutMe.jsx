            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>My background is in life sciences. I have a degree in Biomedical Sciences and I used to work in an NHS medical laboratory. However, I've always had a passion for computing and realised that I really enjoyed the technical side of my role. 
                Thus, I decided to change my career path and learn how to code.
                I love programming an application, debugging it and watching it come to life on screen.</p>

            <h3>Coding Journey</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I began my coding journey with HarvardX's <a className="about_links" href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science" target="_blank">CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</a> course, learning the fundamentals of programming in C.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I learned <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> by reading books, taking <a className="about_links" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> courses and experimenting in VSCode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eventually, I branched out to responsive web design and front-end development libraries including <strong>React</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong>. Building projects from scratch with freeCodeCamp provided a valuable learning experience and further developed my skillset.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Currently, I am undertaking HarvardX's <a className="about_links" href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript" target="_blank">CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</a> course to deepen my knowledge on programming languages involved
                    in the implementation of web apps. Most valuably, I have learned how to use <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, and how to combine every language and library I have learned thus far to make dynamic, user-friendly web applications.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Alongside programming, I like yoga, candle-making and gaming in my free time.</p>
